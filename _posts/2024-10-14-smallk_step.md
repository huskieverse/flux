The Huskiverse is proud to announce the first prototype of the Vespa-mode controller rig! this wooden model wa tested by all of us at the 71 North partnership studio, and we are excited to see how it will evolve into a full-fledged controller. The design is based on the original Vespa scooter, and we are working hard to make it as realistic as possible. The controller will be used in our ongoing projects and will be a great addition to the Huskiverse. We are excited to see what the future holds for this Vespa-mode controller and how it will contribute to our ongoing projects. Stay tuned for more updates as we integrate this controller into our work!
