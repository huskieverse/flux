The Vespa has landed! With a generous donation from our fearless leader federico, we have been able to acquire a real Vespa scooter! already in NIU red and black, this Vespa will be used in future projects and will be a great addition to the Huskiverse. We are excited to see what the future holds for this Vespa and how it will contribute to our ongoing projects. Stay tuned for more updates as we integrate this Vespa into our work!
